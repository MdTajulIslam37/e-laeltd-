            <h1>Sinha’s murder was planned</h1>
            <img src="main_top.jpg" width="97%">
            <p>The 300-page verdict in the murder case of retired Army Major Sinha Mohammad Rashed Khan was read out by Cox’s Bazar District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Ismail at around 2.25pm. Meanwhile, Judge Mohammad Ismail said, “I have tried to find out the details of the Major Sinha murder case. The three APBN members in charge of the three first released Sinha’s car after stopping it, but the police stopped it again for some reason and they were shot within 10 to 20 minutes. This proves that Sinha’s assassination was a premeditated murder.”<br><br>

                Liaquat Ali fired four rounds as confirmed from the testimony of Sinha’s alibi Shahedul Islam Sifat. Liaquat’s statement also called for action against OC Pradeep Sinha. Liaquat admitted to shooting Sinha thinking he had a pistol in his hand. Eventually OC Pradeep reached the spot and kicked Sinha to his left.<br><br>
                
                Similarly, as per the statement of SI Nanda Dulal Rakkhit, “Liaquat had earlier asked to stop the silver car and accompanied him to the check post. Later, Sinha leaned forward with both hands raised. At that time Liaquat fired 4 rounds. Pradeep came to the spot and said, I got you after a lot of trouble. He then kicked the left side of the chest and Sinha fainted. I made a list of belongings ceased out of fear of OC Pradeep. Basically I did as OC Pradeep instructed. This proves that Liaquat and Nanda Dulal played an active role in the murder. OC Pradeep also refused to pay BDT 5 lakh to police sources Nurul Amin, Mohammad Ayaz and Nizam Uddin as part of a plot to assassinate Sinha on the suspicion of robbery.”<br><br>
                
                Earlier, Cox’s Bazar District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Ismail started reading out the verdict in the presence of 15 accused including dismissed OC Pradeep Kumar Das at around 2 pm. OC Pradeep was seen standing in a corner of the courtroom in a state of anxiety and sadness.<br><br>
                
                It can be seen on the spot that there was tight security in the court premises of Cox’s Bazar since morning following the verdict in Sinha murder case. Arriving at the court very early in the morning, the security forces had to cross several obstacles to get from the main gate to the court.<br><br>
                
                Such strict security measures are quite rare for the verdict of a case outside Dhaka. Such tight security measures have only recently been observed during the verdicts of top war criminals at the Dhaka International Criminal Tribunal. Long before the judge arrived, the courtroom was buzzing with journalists and lawyers. Apart from the local journalists, various media workers from Dhaka have also come to the Cox’s Bazar court.<br><br>
                
                Meanwhile, the trial of the case officially started on June 27 last year and ended on January 12 this year with the presentation of arguments of their lawyers for the last two accused. The judge later set January 31 as the date for the verdict. Eighteen months after the murder, the verdict in this case has been given. Sinha’s family wanted the maximum punishment for all the accused involved in the incident. Along with the family, the prosecution also expected maximum punishment for the accused in the case. Defendants say the state could not prove the allegations against some of the defendants. So they will be released. Retired Army Major Sinha Mohammad Rashed was shot dead by police at the APBN checkpost at Shamlapur in Baharchhara on the Cox’s Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive on the night of July 31, 2020. The police filed three cases (two in Teknaf and one in Ramu) as plaintiffs.<br><br>
                
                Sinha, who retired from the army, was in the Himchhari area of Cox’s Bazar for about a month to make a travel documentary called ‘Let’s Go’. He was accompanied by Shahedul Islam Sifat and Shipa Debnath, students of the Film and Media Department at Stamford University.<br><br>
                However, Cox’s Bazar police said at the time that Sinha had “prevented a search” with his identity. He was later shot dead by police on duty at a checkpoint. Sinha’s elder sister Sharmin Shahriar Ferdous filed a murder case against Teknaf Police OC Pradeep Kumar Das, Baharchhara Investigation Center Inspector Liaquat Ali and nine other policemen in Cox’s Bazar court on August 5, five days after the incident. The indictment referred to Sinha’s murder as a “planned incident”.</p>
